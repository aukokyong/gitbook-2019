# Pair Programming

## What is pair programming
Pair programming is a way to share knowledge between people, and understand the logic of how someone arrives at a conclusion.

It is a strict protocol for how to write a program.

## Pairing Protocol
Person A is the **driver** they are concerned with the specfic code at hand.
Person B is the **navigator** they are concerned with the direction of the code, as they don't have to pay as much attention to remembering all of the syntax.

Use floobits to manage the code across two users.

Prequsite:
Have a folder to open:

```
mkdir my-code
cd my-code
touch inde.html
sublime .
```

Share the folder in floobits:
`Share Directory (public)`

User A:
1. Go to the webpage for your current code: https://floobits.com/awongh/sei22/permissions
2. Add your pair and give them the ability to edit.
3. Slack the URL to your code to your pair: https://floobits.com/awongh/sei22

User B:
1. From sublime open the floobits: `cmd+shift+p` type in `Floobits - Join Workspace` (auto-complete will help you) and press return
2. Enter the URL you recieved in slack
